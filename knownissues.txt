General issues
=======================
1.
--Issue--:
If using an unsupported browser without Flash installed, no way currently to prompt to save
host and user information to a file when request a certificate (host or user).
--Workaround--:
Manually copy text from csr textarea and save to a file manually. MUST BE PLAIN TEXT.

2.
--Issue--:
Misleading SEVERE entries in catalina.<date>.log file
Some of the logs have the following SEVERE entries.  However, it appears these 
messages are harmless; over-zealous/erroneous reporting by tomcat. They won't 
cause memory leaks and these particular SEVERE messages can be ignored. Fixed in tomcat >= 7.0.6 

"SEVERE: A web application created a ThreadLocal with key of type 
[org.springframework.core.NamedThreadLocal] (value [Prototype beans currently in creation]) 
and a value of type [null] (value [null]) but failed to remove it when the web 
application was stopped. To prevent a memory leak, the ThreadLocal has been forcibly removed"

Safari issues
=======================
1. 
--Issue--: 
Safari 'remembers' SSL certificate choice and will not prompt again after selection:
https://discussions.apple.com/message/22461058#22461058
--Workaround--: 
Can manually assign desired certificate as shown here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1679

2.
--Issue--:
Safari requires a certificate if there is one in the browser already (cancelling leads to denied page)
even when server is set to clientAuth="want":

http://lists.apple.com/archives/apple-cdsa/2012/Dec/msg00005.html
--Workaround--:
Remove certificates from keychain or select suitable certificate.

3. 
--Issue--:
Safari can't distinguish the correct issuing CA for the clients certificate. 
If you go to the dev CA portal and you don't have a DEV ca cert but you do have a real 
CA cert from the UK CA, then Safari always requests a client cert selection.  
Cancelling leads to denied page.
